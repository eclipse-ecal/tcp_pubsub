   * @brief The Publisher side of tcp_pubsub
   *
   * Once created, a Publisher waits for connections on a port. You can either
   * choose a port to listen on or let that decision to the operating system.
   * See the constructor for more details.
   *
   * A Publisher uses a 1-element send-queue:
   *
   * - 1 message is being sent to a subscriber. As each Subscriber connects
   *   individually and with it's own link speed, this message will not be the
   *   same for each subscription.
   *
   * - One message is being kept as next-message. Once a Session has finished
   *   sending its message to its subscriber, it will take that message as next
   *   one. If messages are provided faster than the link speed can handle, only
   *   the last message is kept and other messages will be dropped.

     * supports sending an indefinite amount of sub-buffers, that will be copied
     * into one internal binary buffer.
     * You may release your memory after this function has returned.
     * 
     * Tip:
     * 
     *   Use this to send your custom Header and Payload as 1 buffer, without
     *   having to copy everything into one continuous memory chunk yourself!
     *   This method will copy the memory anyways (and only if there are active
     *   subsriptions), so copying in your could would be a waste of resources.
     * 
     *   A call could look like this:
     * 
     *     send({{header.data(), header.size()}, {payload.data(), payload.size()}});
     * 
     * The subscriber will receive the data as 1 binary blob containing all
     * sub-buffers in the same order they have been provided to this function.
     * So you need to make sure that your subscriber can recover the information
     * about the length of each sub-buffer, if you require to divide the data,
     * again.
     * 
     * Note that calling this function does not guarantee that the data will
     * physically be sent to the subsribers. Internally, a 1-element-queue is used:
     * 
     *   - 1 Element is currently sent to the subscriber. As TCP works with 1->1
     *     connections, this element may be a different one for all connections,
     *     if e.g. the link speed is different and some connections send their
     *     data faster than others.
     * 
     *   - 1 Element is kept in queue as next element. It will be sent once the
     *     current element has been processed. If you call send too fast, this
     *     buffer will be dropped. tcp_pubsub will always assume that the last
     *     element is the only important one.
     * 
     * If there are no active subscriptions, this function returns immediatelly
     * without doing anything. You don't need to check with getSubsriberCount()
     * in that case.
     * 
     * This method is thread-safe.
     * 
     * @param[in] buffers
     *              List of (sub-)buffers to send to all subscribers
     *
