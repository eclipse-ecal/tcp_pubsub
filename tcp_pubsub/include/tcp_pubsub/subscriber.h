   * @brief The Subscriber side of tcp_pubsub
   * 
   * A subscriber can connect to one or multiple publishers and receive data
   * from them. As TCP actually works with 1:1 connections, you need to create a
   * SubscriberSession for each connection to a publisher.
   * 
   * Once received, you will get the data via a callback. So after creating a
   * Subsriber, you should also call Subscriber::setCallback(). By default, Callbacks are asynchronous (and is is highly recommended that you keep it this way, unless you really know what you are doing!). Subscribers use a 1-element queue:
   * 
   * - 1 message is currently being processed by the callback you set. This
   *   callback runs in it's own thread, so you are allowed to do time-consuming
   *   computations in a callback.
   * 
   * - 1 message is kept as next-message. Once your callback has finished, it
   *   will automatically grab the next message, if available. If messages
   *   arrive too fast and the callback cannot process them, messages are being
   *   dropped, so your callback will always receive the latest data available.
   * 
   * All SubscriberSessions will share the same 1-message queue. It is assumend,
   * that the SubscriberSessions that are created in the same Subscriber are of
   * same "type" (whatever that means for you).

     * - While a synchronous callback is running, no new data can be read from
     *   the socket of the corresponding SubscriberSession. This may cause data
     *   to stack up in the Sockets buffer, if your callback consumes too much
     *   time.
     * - A synchronous callback is exeucted by the Executor's thread-pool. If
     *   your callback needs too long to process, you can cause all Publishers
     *   and Subscriber sessions to block, because the thread pool is busy
     *   processing callbacks and cannot work on the TCP sockets any more
